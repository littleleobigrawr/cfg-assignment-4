A repository made for the 4th assignment for CodeFirstGirls.

> This read me file will be used to detail how I have used Git/GitHub.

**Creating the repo**
I created this repo in the browser, and used git clone (repo url) via the VSCode terminal to clone the repo and access it locally.

**git status**
I used git status to check the currnet branch activity, as it was just cloned it returned:

_Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'._
_nothing to commit, working tree clean_

**creating a branch**
I used the branch button in the bottom left corner of the vs code window to create a new brach.
